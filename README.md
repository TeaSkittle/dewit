# todo

todo is a CLI to-do list written in D and is aimed at both Linux and Windows systems. *Designed to be pratical, simple, and cross platform.*

This project was inspired by [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) which is a fantastic app for those wanting a [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) styled to-do app that is feature packed. But I wanted something that worked similar to Taskwarrior, yet features:

* Has a simple code base 
* Uses just a few essential commands
* Does not adhere to any productivity philospohy 
* Works in both Linux and Windows
* Written in [D](https://dlang.org/)

## Installation

**Will add section later, after main code is complete**

## Usage

```Bash
$ todo a Make bed   # Add task
$ todo l            # list tasks

ID  Task
--------
1   Make bed

$ todo d 1          # Delete task/mark task as complete
```
