**THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ABANDONED**

Was an experiment with D and I ended up not being a fan of the language, repo is now closed

dewit is a CLI to-do list written in D and is aimed at both Linux and Windows systems. *Designed to be pratical, simple, and cross platform.* This is not an app a Jedi would use...

This project was inspired by [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) which is a fantastic app for those wanting a [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) styled to-do app that is feature packed. But I wanted something that worked similar to Taskwarrior, yet features:

* A simple code base 
* Uses just a few essential commands
* Does not adhere to any productivity philospohy 
* Works in both Linux and Windows
* Written in [D](https://dlang.org/)
* UNLIMITED POWER!


## Usage

```Bash
$ dewit a Make bed   # Add task
$ dewit l            # list tasks

ID  Task
--------
1   Make bed

$ dewit d 1          # Delete task/mark task as complete
```
